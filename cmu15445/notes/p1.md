## Extendiable Hash Table
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4GkXtH1la8) explains the insertion algorithm of EHT.

This projects doesn't require implementing shrinking after removing key-value pair from bucket. Thus, only insertion is tricky to implement.

The following is my understanding of EHT insertion algorithm

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    line0["Try Insert"]
    line1["Return"]
    line2["Global Depth > Local Depth? "]
    line3["Update Global/Local Depth and double directory"]
    line4["Update Global/Local Depth"]
    line5["Split the bucket and redistribute buckets"]
    line0 --True-->line1
    line0 --False-->line2
    line2 --True-->line4
    line2 --False-->line3
    line3 --> line5
    line4 --> line5
```
There are two questions:
1. After doubling directory, where should the new unallocated bucket pointer goes?
2. After splitting the bucket, how to redistribute new buckets

To answer the first question, look at the following example

To answer the second question, look at the following example
