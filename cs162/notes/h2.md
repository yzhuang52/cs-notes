# Simple Shell

## Shell Task Explained
Implement a shell that supports 
1. Directory Commands: pwd, cd 
2. Program Execution with path resolution, redirection, pipes
3. Signal Handling
4. Foreground and Background processes

## First Try
Implementing Directory Commands is easy since the skeleton codes already provides an example of how to add new commands. </br>
However, I get stuck at implementing pipes because I try to put all Program Execution codes inside main function. Soon I mess up with the so many cases needed to be dealt with because of this bad programming habits. </br>

For Program Execution, there are many cases
```
1 ./prog # run program inside current working directory
2 /usr/bin/wc shell.c # run program outside of current working directory
3 wc shell.c # run program outside of current working directory with path resolution
4 wc < shell.c, wc shell.c > text.txt # run program with redirection
5 cat shell.c | grep "tokens" | wc # run program with pipes
```

    line3["Is Mode=Redirect?"]
    line4["Execute on Redirect Mode"]
    line5["Is Mode=Pipe?"]
    line6["Execute on Pipe Mode"]
    line7["Ececute on Normal Mode"]
    line1 --> line2
    line2 --> line3
    line3 --True-->line4
    line3 --False-->line5
    line5 --True-->line6
    line5 --False-->line7
```
Because this homework doesn't require complex execution like pipe with redirection, I group the program execution cases with 3 modes: 
1. Normal: any program execution commands without Redirect and Pipe
2. Redirect: program execution commands with > or <
3. Pipe: program execution commands with |

All three modes should support path resolution

## Pipe
Implementing pipe is the hardest task for this assignment.
